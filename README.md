# Deriving literature trends and insights on multi-omics analysis studies in Autism Spectrum Disorder using literature mining pipeline

Here, we demonstrate our literature mining pipeline to accelerate data to insights. Using topic modeling and generative AI techniques, we present a pipeline that can classify scientific literature into thematic clusters and can help in a wide array of applications like knowledgebase creation, conversational virtual assistant, and summarization. Employing our pipeline, we explored the ASD literature, specifically around multi-omics studies to understand the molecular interplay underlying autism brain.
